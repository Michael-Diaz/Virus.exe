# ProductiviTree

This is a Chrome Extension which encourages productivity. Users are rewarded for spending time away from unproductive sites. A tree will grow as long as the user is not on an unproductive (blacklisted) website. If user's tree survives until the end of user's pre-selected time, user's current tree will be added to the forest.
